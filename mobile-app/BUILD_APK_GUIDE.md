# 📱 TimeBASE Mobile APK Build Guide

## 🚀 Quick Start - Build APK

### Prerequisites
```bash
# 1. Install Node.js (v16+)
# Download from: https://nodejs.org/

# 2. Install React Native CLI
npm install -g react-native-cli

# 3. Install Android Studio
# Download from: https://developer.android.com/studio

# 4. Setup Android SDK
# In Android Studio: Tools → SDK Manager
# Install: Android SDK Platform 33, Android SDK Build-Tools 33.0.0
```

### Environment Setup
```bash
# Add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc
export ANDROID_HOME=$HOME/Android/Sdk
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/emulator
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools/bin
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools

# Reload shell
source ~/.bashrc
```

## 📦 Build Steps

### 1. Setup Project
```bash
# Navigate to mobile app directory
cd /home/febrian/project/basecorp/project/timeBASE/mobile-app

# Install dependencies
npm install

# For React Native 0.60+, link native dependencies
cd ios && pod install && cd .. # (if building for iOS)
```

### 2. Start Backend Server
```bash
# In another terminal, start the backend
cd ../backend
npm install
npm start

# Backend should be running on http://localhost:3000
```

### 3. Update API Configuration
```bash
# Edit src/services/apiService.ts
# Change BASE_URL to your backend URL:

const BASE_URL = __DEV__ 
  ? 'http://10.0.2.2:3000/api'  # Android emulator
  : 'https://your-production-api.com/api';
```

### 4. Build Debug APK
```bash
# Build debug APK (for testing)
npx react-native run-android

# Or manually build
cd android
./gradlew assembleDebug

# APK location: android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

### 5. Build Release APK
```bash
# Generate release APK
cd android
./gradlew assembleRelease

# APK location: android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
```

## 🔧 Advanced Build Configuration

### Generate Signed APK (for Play Store)

1. **Generate Keystore**
```bash
cd android/app
keytool -genkeypair -v -storetype PKCS12 -keystore timebase-upload-key.keystore -alias timebase-key-alias -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000
```

2. **Configure Gradle**
```bash
# Create android/gradle.properties
MYAPP_UPLOAD_STORE_FILE=timebase-upload-key.keystore
MYAPP_UPLOAD_KEY_ALIAS=timebase-key-alias
MYAPP_UPLOAD_STORE_PASSWORD=your_keystore_password
MYAPP_UPLOAD_KEY_PASSWORD=your_key_password
```

3. **Build Signed APK**
```bash
cd android
./gradlew assembleRelease
```

## 📱 Testing APK

### Install on Device
```bash
# Connect Android device via USB (enable USB debugging)
adb install android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk

# Or drag & drop APK to device
```

### Test on Emulator
```bash
# Start Android emulator
emulator -avd Pixel_4_API_30

# Install APK
adb install android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Metro bundler issues**
```bash
npx react-native start --reset-cache
```

2. **Android build fails**
```bash
cd android
./gradlew clean
cd ..
npx react-native run-android
```

3. **Network issues (can't connect to backend)**
```bash
# For Android emulator, use 10.0.2.2 instead of localhost
# For physical device, use your computer's IP address
```

4. **Missing dependencies**
```bash
npm install
cd ios && pod install && cd .. # if building for iOS
```
